**Study on the effect of Vitamin D levels in biological samples**

---

## 📘 Introduction
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in calcium and phosphorus metabolism.  
It is essential for bone health, immune system function, and prevention of chronic diseases.

---

## 🔬 Objectives
- To analyze Vitamin D levels in different biological samples.  
- To understand how Vitamin D affects bone and immune functions.  
- To highlight the causes and effects of Vitamin D deficiency.

---

## 🧪 Methodology
1. **Sample collection:** Serum or plasma from volunteers.  
2. **Quantification:** Using spectrophotometric or ELISA techniques.  
3. **Data analysis:** Comparison between deficient and normal groups.  

---

## 📊 Expected Results
- Determination of average Vitamin D levels.  
- Correlation between Vitamin D deficiency and biological parameters.  
- Identification of risk factors related to deficiency.

---

## 🌞 Discussion
Vitamin D deficiency is increasingly common due to reduced sunlight exposure and poor diet.  
Understanding its biological impact helps design preventive strategies and improve overall health.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Maintaining optimal Vitamin D levels is essential for bone strength and immune health.  
Balanced nutrition and moderate sun exposure are the best preventive measures.
